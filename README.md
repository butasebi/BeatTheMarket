# Beat the Market
## Concept
Beat the Market is a fun way to find out more and get a glimpse of what it takes to make a real-time investment in different stocks, cryptocurrencies and index funds, based on historical data about them. You can start by choosing your favourite category and an appropriate time frame ranging between 12 hours, 1 year and 10 years.
After finding out whether your buying/selling actions were inspired at a certain time and the result was either beating the market or not, you can check the public leaderboard to see other players' performance. By creating an account, you can also see your previous attempts on beating the market.
